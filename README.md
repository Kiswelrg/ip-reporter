## Ip-Reporter
Email you if your linux pc's ip address changes. This project helps me when I want to log in to my server pc at the lab when I'm in my dorm, because they all share the same school public LAN. Since our school internet condition is unstable, my pc's ip address changes frequently, this is the only workaround that works for me.

### Usage
1. run start.sh and start_checkip.sh after changing file dirs in scripts.  
2. replace 'YourPPPoeName' with yours after command nmcli c up, it is the pppoe connection name created in your linux.

### Platform
linux
