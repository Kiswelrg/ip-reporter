## Ip-Reporter
Email you when your linux machine's ip address changes.

### Motive
Couldn't afford some cloud drive, so instead I use my pc(intel i3 without a dedicated gpuüëç) from the lab at school.  
This project helps me a lot when I want to log in to my pc located at the lab when I'm at my dorm. Since our school internet condition is unstable asf, my pc's ip address changes frequently, this is the only workaround that works for me.  

### Usage
1. run start.sh and start_checkip.sh after changing file dirs in scripts.  
2. replace 'YourPPPoeName' with yours after command `nmcli c up`, it is the network connection name stored and created in NetworkManager, I created mine via opening `nm-connection-editor`.

### Platform
linux
